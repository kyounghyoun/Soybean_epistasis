# Soybean_epistasis
Pulbicably available data of 2,662 soybean cultivar (G. max) accessions from "Genome-wide Association and Epistatic Interactions of Flowering Time in Soybean Cultivar".

# Description
VCF file containing genotype information for 2,662 soybean cultivar (G.max) accessions.


# Data explanation
The Axiom™ 180k SoyaSNP was used to genotype 4,234 soybean accessions. 
Among the 4,234 soybean accessions, the wild-type soybeans were discarded as the phenotypic data of the flowering time was not investigated. 
Using only 2,872 cultivar Glycine max accessions, 210 duplicated and admixed soybean accessions were discarded for further analysis.
All samples were collected from the National Agrobiodiversity Center in the Rural Development Administration (RDA, Jeonju, Korea), which originated from S.Korea (2,415), N.Korea (96), U.S.A (60), China (59), and Japan (32).
The genotype data are provided from our cooperation project (k-crop.kr; Currently not available) in the Soybase.org of total 4,234 soybean accessions comprising 2,662 soybean cultivar accessions.
